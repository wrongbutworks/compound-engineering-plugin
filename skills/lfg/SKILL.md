CRITICAL: You MUST execute every step below IN ORDER. Do NOT skip any required step. Do NOT jump ahead to coding or implementation. The plan phase (step 1) MUST be completed and verified BEFORE any work begins. Violating this order produces bad output.

When invoking any skill referenced below, resolve its name against the available-skills list the host platform provides and use that exact entry. Some platforms list skills under a plugin namespace (e.g., `compound-engineering:ce-plan`); others list the bare name. Invoking a short-form guess that isn't in the list will fail — always match a listed entry verbatim before calling the Skill/Task tool.

1. Invoke the `ce-plan` skill with `$ARGUMENTS`.

   GATE: STOP. If ce-plan reported the task is non-software and cannot be processed in pipeline mode, stop the pipeline and inform the user that LFG requires software tasks. Otherwise, verify that the `ce-plan` workflow produced a plan file in `docs/plans/`. If no plan file was created, invoke `ce-plan` again with `$ARGUMENTS`. Do NOT proceed to step 2 until a written plan exists. **Record the plan file path** — it will be passed to ce-work in step 2 and ce-code-review in step 4.

   Read the plan metadata before continuing. If the plan has `artifact_contract: ce-unified-plan/v1`, proceed only when it has `artifact_readiness: implementation-ready` and `execution: code`. Stop the pipeline for `artifact_readiness: requirements-only`, any unrecognized readiness value, `execution: knowledge-work`, approach-plan outputs, answer-seeking/universal outputs, or invalid progress-like readiness values. LFG never launches `/goal` directly; when goal-mode or dynamic workflows are appropriate, `ce-work` owns that implementation engine choice and must return control to LFG afterward.

2. Invoke the `ce-work` skill with `mode:return-to-caller <plan-path-from-step-1>`.

   GATE: STOP. Verify that implementation work was performed - files were created or modified beyond the plan. Read the structured return and require `status: complete`, the same plan path, changed files, U-IDs attempted/completed when present, verification results, blocker list, behavior-change signal, and `standalone_shipping_skipped: true`. When `behavior_change: true`, also require `verification_evidence` that names the relevant units/tasks, existing tests inspected, tests added/changed or used unchanged, red failure or characterization evidence when applicable, verification run, and any deliberate test exception. Do NOT decide the test strategy inside LFG; the evidence is ce-work's contract.

   If `behavior_change: true` but `verification_evidence` is missing or too vague to tell how behavior was protected, invoke `ce-work` one more time with the same `mode:return-to-caller <plan-path-from-step-1>` argument. Do not prompt the user and do not alter the plan path argument. The retry relies on ce-work's idempotency path to inspect the already-implemented work, fill the missing evidence, and return without reimplementing. If the second return still lacks coherent verification evidence, stop as blocked and report the missing fields instead of continuing to simplify/review/ship.

3. Invoke the `ce-simplify-code` skill on the branch diff.

   This runs before review so the code-review in step 4 covers the simplified code. **Skip** this step when the change is docs-only (only markdown/docs paths changed) or trivial (roughly under 10 changed lines). Otherwise let `ce-simplify-code` resolve the branch-diff scope itself; it preserves behavior and runs the test suite.

   Do not commit in this step. `ce-simplify-code` leaves its changes in the working tree; step 4's review scopes the working tree (uncommitted changes included), and step 8's `ce-commit-push-pr` commits whatever remains. Committing here would sweep any still-uncommitted `ce-work` edits into a misleading `refactor` commit and could stall on a tree that never goes clean.

4. Invoke the `ce-code-review` skill with `mode:agent plan:<plan-path-from-step-1>`.

   Pass the plan file path from step 1 so ce-code-review can verify requirements completeness. Read the **Actionable Findings** summary the skill emits.

   `mode:agent` is report-only **by design** — it surfaces findings but never edits the tree; LFG applies the eligible ones in step 5. When narrating progress to the user, frame this as "review found X → applied X in step 5," not as "code review did not auto-fix." A report-only review followed by an LFG-applied fix is the intended contract, not a gap.

**Shipping precondition (steps 5–9).** Run `git remote` once before the shipping steps. If it lists **no remote** (e.g. a sandbox/throwaway checkout that has `git init` but no `origin`), shipping is **local-only**: make every commit the steps below call for, but **skip every push, PR create/edit, and CI-watch action** — the pushes in steps 5 and 6, the push and PR creation in step 8, and step 9 in full. A missing remote is a terminal local-only state, not an error: never retry a push or hunt for a remote — make the local commits and proceed to step 10. Run steps 5–9 normally when a remote exists.

5. **Apply and persist review fixes** (REQUIRED after step 4, before residual handoff)

   Load `references/review-followup.md` and execute its apply step (mechanical apply + commit/push when changes exist). Do not proceed to the residual handoff, run browser tests, or output DONE while eligible review fixes remain only in the working tree uncommitted.

6. **Autonomous residual handoff** (only when step 4 reported one or more actionable `downstream-resolver` findings not applied in step 5; skip when it reported `Actionable findings: none.`)

   Do not prompt the user. This step embraces the autopilot contract: residuals must become durable before DONE, but the agent never stops to ask.

   1. Load `references/tracker-defer.md` in **non-interactive mode**. Pass the residual actionable findings from step 4/5 (or the run artifact when the summary was truncated).
   2. Collect the structured return: `{ filed: [...], failed: [...], no_sink: [...] }`.
   3. Compose a `## Residual Review Findings` markdown section from the structured return (this goes into the committed record file in step 4, **not** the PR body):
      - For each item in `filed`: a bullet with severity, file:line, title, and a link to the tracker ticket URL.
      - For each item in `failed`: a bullet with severity, file:line, title, and the failure reason (e.g., `Defer failed: gh returned 401 — tracker unavailable`).
      - For each item in `no_sink`: a bullet with severity, file:line, and title inlined verbatim so the committed record file is the durable record.
   4. **Durable record — never the PR body.** Do NOT write a `## Residual Review Findings` section into the PR description; it duplicates GitHub's own tracking and goes stale as items resolve. Review residuals have no GitHub thread of their own, so they are made durable by the tracker tickets filed in step 2 plus a committed record file — not a PR-body section and not a PR comment that duplicates the tickets. Create/replace `docs/residual-review-findings/<branch-or-head-sha>.md` with the composed section (ticket links included) and the source run context. Stage only that file, commit `docs(review): record residual review findings`, and push **when a remote is configured** (per the shipping precondition): if an upstream exists, `git push`; else if a remote exists, resolve a writable one (prefer `origin`, otherwise the first configured remote) and `git push --set-upstream <remote> HEAD`; if there is no remote at all, the local commit is the durable sink.

   Do not output DONE until the residuals are durable (tracker tickets filed and/or the record file committed). Never block DONE on tracker filing failures once the record file exists. A push that fails when a remote exists is a stop-and-report; never retry a push, or block DONE, when no remote exists.

7. Invoke the `ce-test-browser` skill with `mode:pipeline`.

8. Invoke the `ce-commit-push-pr` skill with `mode:pipeline`.

   This commits any remaining changes, pushes the branch, and opens a pull request — non-interactively, per the mode token. If it prints a `New concepts:` trailer after the PR URL, record the concept name(s) for step 10. If step 6 already opened a PR (check with `gh pr view --json number,url,state 2>/dev/null`), skip PR creation but still commit and push any uncommitted changes. **Per the shipping precondition, when no remote is configured, do NOT invoke `ce-commit-push-pr` — its commit step pushes unconditionally (`git push -u origin HEAD`), so a literal invocation would still hit the impossible push. Instead commit any remaining changes locally yourself (`git add -A && git commit`) and skip the push and PR creation entirely.**

9. **Drive CI to green via `ce-babysit-pr`** (only when an open PR exists for the current branch)

   Detect the PR; if none exists or `gh` is unavailable, skip this step entirely and proceed to step 10.

   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number,url,state
   ```

   Invoke **`ce-babysit-pr mode:pipeline <pr-url>`**. It runs the bounded pipeline loop: watches CI, repairs real (convergent) failures via `ce-debug mode:pipeline` — never weakening, skipping, or mocking an assertion — resolves any review comments that arrived via `ce-resolve-pr-feedback mode:pipeline`, and stops when CI is decided or its budget (default 3 fix rounds) is hit. This replaces LFG's former hand-rolled CI loop; do not reimplement CI-watching here.

   Collect its structured result (`{ status, fixes_applied, residuals }`). It surfaces unfixable CI as a **run-report comment on the PR** and returns residuals — do **NOT** write a `## CI Failures Unresolved` PR-body section. A `needs-human` residual (a fix that would need a product/design decision) is deferred, not applied — that is the autopilot contract, unchanged. Do not block DONE once babysit has surfaced residuals.

10. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when complete

    If step 8 recorded a `New concepts:` trailer, first echo one line per concept: `New concept introduced: <name> — run /ce-explain <name> to go deeper.`

    If an open PR exists, add one line pointing the user to the interactive watch-to-merge (pipeline mode stopped at "CI decided," not "merged"): `PR is moving — run /ce-babysit-pr <pr-url> to watch it through review to merge.` Then output the DONE promise.

Start with step 1 now. Remember: plan FIRST, then work. Never skip the plan.
